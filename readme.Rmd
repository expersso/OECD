### Introduction

The `OECD` package allows the user to download data from the OECD's API in a
dynamic and reproducible way.

The package can be installed from either CRAN or Github (development version):

```{r loadLibrary, eval=FALSE}
# from CRAN
install.packages("OECD")

# from Github
library(devtools)
install_github("expersso/OECD")

library(OECD)
```

### How to use the package

Unless you know the exact code of the series you're looking for, the best way to
start is by downloading a dataframe with all the available datasets and their 
descriptions, and then run searches on it. The search string can be a regular
expression and is case-insensitive by default.

```{r get_datasets, eval=FALSE}
dataset_list <- get_datasets()
search_dataset("unemployment", data = dataset_list)
```

```r
id                title
AVD_DUR           Average duration of unemployment
AEO2012_CH6_FIG19 Figure 19: The trade off between vulnerable employment...
AEO2012_CH6_FIG29 Figure 29: Youth employment and unemployment by education...
AEO2012_CH6_FIG4  Figure 4: Youth and adult unemployment
DUR_I             Incidence of unemployment by duration
DUR_D             Unemployment by duration
```

In the following we'll explore the `DUR_D` data set, which contains data on 
the duration of unemployment.

```{r dataset}
dataset <- "DUR_D"
```

Before downloading the series we are interested in, it is often prudent to look 
at the data structure, to see what type of breakdowns the data set offers:

```{r first_sleep, echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(5)
```

```{r get_data_structure}
dstruc <- get_data_structure(dataset)
str(dstruc, max.level = 1)
```

The `get_data_structure` function returns a list of dataframes with
human-readable values for variable names and values. The first data frame
contains the variable names and shows the dimensions of a dataset:

```{r show_var_desc}
dstruc$VAR_DESC
```

It is often easiest not to specify any filters at this point, but rather
download the entire dataset and then filter it with native `R` functions.
However, sometimes the dataset is very large, so filtering it before download
will cut down on download time. To illustrate, let's find out the available
filters for the variables `SEX` and `AGE`:

```{r breakdowns}
dstruc$SEX
dstruc$AGE
```

Let's say we're only interested in the duration of unemployment of men aged 20
to 24 in Germany and France. We provide these filters in the form of a list to 
the `filter` argument of the `get_dataset` function:

```{r get_dataset}
filter_list <- list(c("DEU", "FRA"), "MW", "2024")
df <- get_dataset(dataset = dataset, filter = filter_list)
head(df)
```

Let's say we're only interested in long-term unemployment. We can then first
look at the variable `DURATION` to find the different levels, then go back to
our list of variable descriptions to learn what they mean:

```{r duration}
unique(df$DURATION)
dstruc$DURATION
```

We could of course merge the two data structures, but working with the mnemonic
labels usually saves you quite a bit of typing in the long run.

### Plotting the results

We can now subset to only those unemployed for a year or more, and finally
produce a plot.

```{r plot, cache = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Unemployment rates of foreign- and native-born populations"}
df_plot <- df[df$DURATION == "UN5", ]
df_plot$obsTime <- as.numeric(df_plot$obsTime)

library(ggplot2)

qplot(data = df_plot, x = obsTime, y = obsValue, color = COUNTRY, geom = "line") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Persons, thousands", color = NULL,
       title = "Number of long-term unemployed men, aged 20-24")
```

If we want more in-depth information about a dataset (e.g. methodology, exact
definitions of variables, etc), `browse_metadata` opens up a web
browser with the metadata for the requested series.

```{r browse_metadata, eval=FALSE}
browse_metadata(dataset)
```

```{r second_sleep, echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(5)
```

### Alternative data-acquisition strategy

If one does not know exactly what data one is looking for, or if a data set 
contains e.g. a large number of breakdowns, it is often easier to first explore 
the data on the [OECD stats website](http://stats.oecd.org) and then use the
`oecd` package to make the data acquisition programmatic and reproducible. The
workflow would then be as follows:

1. Find the data set and apply relevant filters on the OECD website.
1. Select "Export -> SDMX (XML)"
1. Copy the generated filter expression (which follows directly after the data set name, 
see screenshot below).
1. Insert this expression as the value to the `filter` argument of the `get_dataset` 
function and set the `pre_formatted` argument to `TRUE`.

```{r example}
df <- get_dataset("PATS_REGION",
                  filter = "PCT_A.INVENTORS.BEL+BE10.TOTAL+BIOTECH", 
                  pre_formatted = TRUE)
head(df)
```

### Other information

The OECD API is currently a beta version and ["and in preparation for the full
release, the structure and content of datasets are being reviewed and are likely
to evolve"](http://stats.oecd.org/OpenDataAPI/index.htm). As a result, the
`OECD` package may break from time to time, as I update it to incorporate 
changes to the API. If you notice a bug (or if you have suggestions for 
improvements), please don't hesitate to contact me or send a pull request.

This package is in no way officially related to or endorsed by the OECD.
